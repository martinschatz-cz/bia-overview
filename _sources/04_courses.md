## Image Analysis and Data Processing in Super-Resolution Microscopy
The workshop, “Image analysis and data processing in the super-resolution microscopy”, is being organized yearly from 2019. It is a comprehensive program that covers the principles, methods, and practical applications of super-resolution microscopy. The workshop will take place at the VMCF Microscopy Center in Praha 2, Czech Republic. The program features talks on topics such as super-resolution microscopy methods, image processing, and data management, as well as hands-on sessions using ThunderSTORM and Fiji/ImageJ software. The program usualy includes guest lectures on functional organization of the cell nucleus and object detection using StarDist.
