# Introduction

## Bioimage Analysis (BIAS)
*Digital image analysis generally aims at designing computer algorithms to mimic the human recognition of patterns and contexts in order to let computers "understand" images.* In turn **Bioimage analysis** focuses on the quantitative measurement of biological systems by processing multidimensional image data. It hence aims at being as objective as possible in measuring Bioimages and estimating the underlying numerical parameters of the biological systems they capture, independently of human observation.

### Bioimage Analysts
We consider that bioimaging involves four different types of expertise.

 * **Life Scientists** (e.g. Biologists)  ask questions and seek answer by setting up experiments.
 * **Instrumentalists** (e.g. Microscopists) develop optical systems, collaborate and provide support for the acquisition of BioImage data.
 * **Developers** (e.g. Image processing algorithm developers, programmers and computer scientists) provide novel algorithms and their implementations to process images.
 * **Bioimage analysts** are a new type of experts in BioImaging, they select appropriate image processing algorithms and their implementations, and assemble them for conducting practical Bioimage Analysis.
