## Communities

### Image.sc Forum
[forum.image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/)

This forum’s focus is software-oriented aspects of scientific imaging, particularly (but not limited to) image analysis, processing, acquisition, storage, and management of digital scientific images. Everyone is welcome to ask questions. It’s for beginners and experts; life scientists and computer scientists; for practical questions and theoretical approaches to solving scientific problems with images. The primary objective is to foster independent learning 170 for everyone in the community.


### Microforum
[forum.microlist.org](https://forum.microlist.org/)

Microforum’s focus is hardware, acquisition, and specimen-related aspects of scientific imaging, particularly (but not limited to) theory and practical use of optical microscopes and detectors, fluorescent proteins and probes, and specimen preparation.

### ITK
[discourse.itk.org](https://discourse.itk.org/)

A place to discuss image analysis with the Insight Toolkit (ITK). This includes the pragmatics of programming with the library, image processing theory, how to address specific problems, and how to contribute to the community.

### Official forum of KNIME Analytics Platform
