## Communities

### Image.sc Forum
[forum.image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/)

If you have any kind of question, this is place to start. You can get here answers even sniplets of codes in matter of hour - all thanks to very active community.

This forum’s focus is software-oriented aspects of scientific imaging, particularly (but not limited to) image analysis, processing, acquisition, storage, and management of digital scientific images. Everyone is welcome to ask questions. It’s for beginners and experts; life scientists and computer scientists; for practical questions and theoretical approaches to solving scientific problems with images. The primary objective is to foster independent learning 170 for everyone in the community.


### Microforum
[forum.microlist.org](https://forum.microlist.org/)

Microforum’s focus is hardware, acquisition, and specimen-related aspects of scientific imaging, particularly (but not limited to) theory and practical use of optical microscopes and detectors, fluorescent proteins and probes, and specimen preparation.

### ITK
[discourse.itk.org](https://discourse.itk.org/)

A place to discuss image analysis with the Insight Toolkit (ITK). This includes the pragmatics of programming with the library, image processing theory, how to address specific problems, and how to contribute to the community.

### Official forum of KNIME Analytics Platform
[forum.knime.com](https://forum.knime.com/)

Official forum of KNIME Analytics Platform, an open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept.

### [Avoiding Twisted Pixels: Ethical Guidelines for the Appropriate Use and Manipulation of Scientific Digital Images](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-010-9201-y)
Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged. One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines. Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with what should or should not be done, but not the associated ‘why’ that is required for understanding the rules. This article proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines. These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and begin to bring an end to the culture of “data beautification”.

### [Reproducible image handling and analysis](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105889)
Image data are universal in life sciences research. Their proper handling is not. A significant proportion of image data in research papers show signs of mishandling that undermine their interpretation. We propose that a precise description of the image processing and analysis applied is required to address this problem. A new norm for reporting reproducible image analyses will diminish mishandling, as it will alert co-authors, referees, and journals to aberrant image data processing or, if published nonetheless, it will document it to the reader. To promote this norm, we discuss the effectiveness of this approach and give some step-by-step instructions for publishing reproducible image data processing and analysis workflows.

### [Accuracy and precision in quantitative fluorescence microscopy](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.200903097)
The light microscope has long been used to document the localization of fluorescent molecules in cell biology research. With advances in digital cameras and the discovery and development of genetically encoded fluorophores, there has been a huge increase in the use of fluorescence microscopy to quantify spatial and temporal measurements of fluorescent molecules in biological specimens. Whether simply comparing the relative intensities of two fluorescent specimens, or using advanced techniques like Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), quantitation of fluorescence requires a thorough understanding of the limitations of and proper use of the different components of the imaging system. Here, I focus on the parameters of digital image acquisition that affect the accuracy and precision of quantitative fluorescence microscopy measurements.
