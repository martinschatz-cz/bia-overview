## Workshops

### Image Analysis and Data Processing in Super-Resolution Microscopy
The workshop, “Image analysis and data processing in the super-resolution microscopy”, has been organized yearly since 2019. It is a comprehensive program that covers the principles, methods, and practical applications of super-resolution microscopy. The workshop will take place at the VMCF Microscopy Center in Praha 2, Czech Republic. The program features talks on topics such as super-resolution microscopy methods, image processing, and data management, as well as hands-on sessions using ThunderSTORM and Fiji/ImageJ software. The program usually includes guest lectures on the functional organization of the cell nucleus and object detection using StarDist. The coffee break and refreshments are included, and there will also be an informal discussion at the Academic Club.

The repository contains the datasets, the scripts, solutions and slides needed for the 3h course "Introduction to R for bioimage analysis" given by Marion Louveaux during the [NEUBIAS Training School 10 for Early Career Investigators in Luxembourg in 2019](http://eubias.org/NEUBIAS/training-schools/eci/ts10-luxembourg-2019/).

### Blender for Biologists
This is a course on blender, an open-source 3D modeling software, for biological visualization. This is created initially for the 2023 EMBL Predoc Course but will stay online afterwards, as resources on microscopy data visualization in blender seem sparse on the web. 

The development of the supporting add-on has moved to [a separate repo](https://github.com/oanegros/tif2bpy) as it outgrew the scope of this course. **This tif2bpy repository holds the current version of the tif loader,** I will try to update the workshop to fit the new version, but this will take some time (see issue #16).
